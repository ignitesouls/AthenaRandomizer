## 🏛️ Lore Description
> ATHENA RANDOMIZER — She Who Shuffles the Battlefield
>
> In the lands between fate and fire, the goddess Athena presides not only over war and wisdom—but also over chaos by design. In her divine cunning, she weaves uncertainty into the realm of strategy, scattering spells, incantations, and weapons across the map as offerings to those who would challenge her domain.
>
> Those who compete in the trials of Elden Ring bingo enter a battlefield touched by her hand—where no two journeys are the same, and foresight bends to fortune. The Athena Randomizer is not mere madness; it is the trial of intellect, adaptability, and courage.
>
> In every match, she watches—guiding none, favoring none, but ever demanding mastery of the unexpected.
